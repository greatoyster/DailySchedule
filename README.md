# Day0
Today I applied for this project and admitted later. The tutor told me that I'd better take it step by step. To record my daily schedule, I create this repo.
The first task is to learn Rust programming language. I plan to finished the first part before 5 July 2020. Before 3 July, I have to prepare my final exams, So I will spend 2 hours per day during this period.
